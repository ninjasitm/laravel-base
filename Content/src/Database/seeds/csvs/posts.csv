# What is Serverless?

So here we are with yet another new term to learn: Serverless. The good thing is that it’s pretty self-explanatory. Serverless, or lack of dedicated servers if you will, is a way of managing your IT infrastructure that reduces costs, while also lowering the time spent setting up and maintaining your backend infrastructure. Think of it as a way of further simplifying what the cloud is supposed to do. If that’s too simple try these definitions:

> “Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or “BaaS”) or on custom code that’s run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or “FaaS”)…” -- (Maruti Techlabs, 2017)

Or as Amazon describes it eloquently:

> ""Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable."" (Amazon)

You can now genuinely focus on the core functionality that affects your business and product, rather than the infrastructure that it runs on. This will lead to lower costs, more fine grained monitoring of usage and less headache to worry about as you grow your business.

# Why is this important?

As we evolve into the Work 2.0 paradigm of entrepreneurship and a more automated economy, we face a challenge of efficiency and lack of knowledge. As a business owner, do you need to know the cloud inside and out? Should you even care about the cloud at this stage? Understanding when too much knowledge is not necessary is just as important as understanding when you need that knowledge. Serverless computing can allow you to quickly develop your idea without worrying about the underlying servers or technology that runs your idea and business. You focus on the things that matter right now: Saving time, saving money, making more money and having fun while doing it.

#How can it benefit you?
## Save Time

> “IT must relearn the vocabulary of business: money. And in doing so remove IT jargon from this process.” -- (Walker, 2017)

Your tech team probably requires two developers, an admin, and a DevOps guy. What if you could eliminate the admin position, no hard feelings, and the DevOps position, no hard feelings, and execute your vision faster.

## Save Money
The more time you spend addressing technical issues that affect your customers, the more money you lose. Additionally if your team had more time they could focus on more security related issues relevant to your business. Serverless infrastructure helps you be more efficient and secure leading to saved money and minimized risk of security issues that could cost you money. A perfect example comes from 3wks (Walker, 2017) who explains that switching from Amazon AWS cloud hosting helped them to reduce costs from $4, 500/month fixed cost to a, maximum, $600/month bill with even better performance and reliability than before. That’s the cost of a full time employee. What would you do with another full time employee?

## Make More Money
How many transactions do you process per second? 10, 20, 50? What if that number grew 5x? You'd need your tech team to make sure resources are scaled and can accommodate the new load. Remember that more resources means more money out of your pocket. The way serverless functions work, you pay only for what you use at a fraction of the cost of managed cloud infrastructure. Save money even as you serve a growing customer base.

## Have Fun Running Your Business
You started your business not just to make money it to enjoy life. If managing your technology is a headache or your current setup distracts you from truly creating value, then serverless may be the answer. Make more money while having fun.

# What is chatbot technology?
> “ Essentially, a chatbot is just a robot chat that imitates human conversations through voice commands, text chats, or both. It's a virtual conversation in which one party is an online talking robot.” (Nguyen, 2017)

Chatbots take text or voice input from a user. NLP (Natural Language Processing) technology is then used to understand what a user says. It can then respond based on scripted logic or incorporate AI (Artifical Intelligence) technology to respond, predict, recommend and take action based on what the user says. A chatbot is a cost effective, efficient way of communicating with your target market.

# Why is it important?

## People are already searching for chatbots
People are looking for doctor chatbots for quick medical help, delivery and scheduling chatbots to order food, deliver packages, shopping chatbots to help order products and services online and more. Are you making sure you’re answering their needs?

> “People are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.” (Rajas, Twitter)

## Conversational AI is not a fad

Since chatbots are generally limited, and scripted, we can use AI (Artificial Intelligence) to make our chatbots smarter. For example we can add ordering, order status and more to our chatbots with conversational AI services. This enables a rich and more meaningful experience for your user. Would your service or product benefit from automations such as ordering, status information or more?

*© Chatbot Magazine 2017*

We are changing the way we communicate. With AI, better hardware and uniquitous access, a chatbot could be the first line of contact for you and your business, service or product.

> “In the future, talking to a bot will be like talking to a real person who has instant access to entire databases of information and can process your thoughts and desires instantly.” (Schlicht, 2017)

# How does it help you?
Have you ever spent time filtering potential leads and figuring out whether someone is a good fit for you? What if you could automate this process with a chatbot that asks the right questions from the start? Chatbots can help you filter the fans of your service or product with no overhead costs.

The age of the standalone mobile app with multitudes of functionality is near capacity. Many users are finding that they are either downloading too many apps, are running out of space or, frankly, just don’t care about apps. A mobilized website with a conversational AI chatbot could provide all of the functionality on your website. Even a chatbot on Facebook’s platform could prove more value to your customers than a full fledged app.
 
A Chatbot with voice is like an employee, with the difference being that it is noticeably cheaper and consistent. With either voice or text interaction, you can automate some of the more mundane or repetitive parts of your service and immediately see your user satisfaction go up.

> “Language is the most natural interface humans understand, and that’s the interface that bots use.” (Schlicht, 2017)

# How can we help?
We can help you understand whether a chatbot will make sense for your product or service. Would a customized chatbot on your website result in more sales? Would a mobile app centered around chatbot technology be a better investment? 

Once we help you understand how a chatbot can fit your business, we can then help you build it. We can build chatbot applications for:

1. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or your Website
1. Healthcare, customer service or eCommerce
1. Alexa or Google Home

<p>“People are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.” (Rajas, Twitter)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conversational AI is not a fad</h2>
<p>Since chatbots are generally limited, and scripted, we can use AI (Artificial Intelligence) to make our chatbots smarter. For example we can add ordering, order status and more to our chatbots with conversational AI services. This enables a rich and more meaningful experience for your user. Would your service or product benefit from automations such as ordering, status information or more?</p>

<p>We are changing the way we communicate. With AI, better hardware and uniquitous access, a chatbot could be the first line of contact for you and your business, service or product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the future, talking to a bot will be like talking to a real person who has instant access to entire databases of information and can process your thoughts and desires instantly.” (Schlicht, 2017)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>How does it help you?</h1>
<p>Have you ever spent time filtering potential leads and figuring out whether someone is a good fit for you? What if you could automate this process with a chatbot that asks the right questions from the start? Chatbots can help you filter the fans of your service or product with no overhead costs.</p>
<p>The age of the standalone mobile app with multitudes of functionality is near capacity. Many users are finding that they are either downloading too many apps, are running out of space or, frankly, just don’t care about apps. A mobilized website with a conversational AI chatbot could provide all of the functionality on your website. Even a chatbot on Facebook’s platform could prove more value to your customers than a full fledged app.</p>
<p>A Chatbot with voice is like an employee, with the difference being that it is noticeably cheaper and consistent. With either voice or text interaction, you can automate some of the more mundane or repetitive parts of your service and immediately see your user satisfaction go up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Language is the most natural interface humans understand, and that’s the interface that bots use.” (Schlicht, 2017)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>How can we help?</h1>
<p>We can help you understand whether a chatbot will make sense for your product or service. Would a customized chatbot on your website result in more sales? Would a mobile app centered around chatbot technology be a better investment? </p>
<p>Once we help you understand how a chatbot can fit your business, we can then help you build it. We can build chatbot applications for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or your Website</li>
<li>Healthcare, customer service or eCommerce</li>
<li>Alexa or Google Home </li>
</ol>

When you understand your market, you can provide them with a product or service that solves their real problems. People are driven by word of mouth and emotions. In short, you dictate how your customer feels by giving them the experience they want, with your unique brand personality.
# Why is it important?
## Mobile first
Most computing is done on mobile devices these days.


![StatCounter-comparison-ww-monthly-201610-201710.png](https://www.nitm.co/storage/app/uploads/public/5a2/0a0/5b0/5a20a05b00363772192703.png)

If your website or service is not designed to be accessed from a mobile device then you're missing out on clients and revenue. 
## Give them what they want
Successful services and products are meant to solve specific problems for your client. You need to understand the type of experience your customer expects.

> “...keeping your users mindsets and not changing a pattern they are already used to, so that’s why it’s so important to understand what are the common patterns in the industry and what is the expected behaviour on certain features.” (UX Boot Camp)

If the user thinks your service is too complex for what you offer, they will seek your more user friendly competitor. If that competitor doesn't exist an innovator will take note and implement a more pleasing alternative.

> “Users are more likely to remember the behavior than the look and feel itself.” (UX Boot Camp)
Not just a customer but a fan

## Fans talk, fans defend and fans promote.
When your customer feels appreciated and feels like you've listened you will have gained a fan of your brand. Research shows that spheres of influence are the most effective way to reach a wider market. Find your influencer, make them happy and see your reach grow as they rave about your product or service.

> “The first step to turning your customers into brand loyalists is to ensure your customers have a top- notch experience every time they visit your page or contact your customer service. If you make your customer feel like they are the only thing that matters in that moment in time, they will be sure to remember it.” (BizJournals.com)

# How does it help you?
## Less confusion means more opportunities
How long did it take you to learn to use your mobile phone? Did you struggle? Customers who don't know what they need to do with your service or product will find a more user friendly competitor.
## More meaningful activity means more relevant data
If you know what you want your customer to do and they actually do it, then you can collect the data based on relevant activity. If you don't care how many times they look at the time on your app, why make it prominent. Give the user an experience that allows you to extract the type of data that help you take action to grow your business.
## A happy customer is a paying customer
> “Customers Who Don’t Feel Valued Leave” 

Although a great design is appealing, it takes a smooth and simple experience to be able to convert a one time user into a happy user who returns to use your product or service. Return users are more likely to spend money on your service if they find the product easy to use and useful. Understanding what is simple for your market is key to making sure your user remains your user.

> “Low prices can always be beaten. Stunning design ages quickly and can easily be copied. Impeccable uptime can be matched, and your features copied. However, a good customer relationship is unique, and loyal customers are hard to steal.” (Smashing Magazine)
